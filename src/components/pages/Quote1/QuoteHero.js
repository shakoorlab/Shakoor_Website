          â€œSorghum is an incredible plant that holds great promise as a
          carbon-sequestering crop. We believe sorghum can be optimized to
          potentially capture and store more carbon and, combined with its
          inherent traits such as drought tolerance, make a positive
          contribution to both food security resiliency and the mitigation of
          negative climate impact"
